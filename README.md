# Rentable Ethereum Token Contracts

The project aims to develop Rentable versions of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155
Solidity token contracts. Existing OpenZeppelin contracts are enhanced to support the
rentability features of tokens. In addition, a web user interface based on ethers.js and
a Python interface will be developed to facilitate contract configuration, deployment,
exploring, managing token rental intervals. The goal is for the system to be compatible
with multiple blockchains, and testing will be conducted on testnet chains including
Avalanche, Hedera, Binance, and Base. The project will demonstrate the system’s
functionality through applications such as renting hotel rooms and homes.
